    A context manager that either:
    - yields True if you are the "early bird" (the first worker to call this function
    with the tmp_dir and lock_keys you provided)
    - yields False only after the the early bird has finished (i.e. exited the managed context).

    The lock that manages who is and isn't the early bird:
    - is identified by the `tmp_dir` and the `lock_keys`
    - is created if it doesn't exist
    - is saved as a file in the tmp_dir path

    Use like so:

    early_bird_lock(mytmp_dir, testrun_id, 'build-image') as should_build:
      if should_build:
        # ... build the image. Other worker will wait until this is done.
      else:
        # ... image is already built
